  	In the past machine learning relied heavily on algorithms designed by experts to solve a specific task. Which lead to highly sophisticated algorithms, which could be grasped only by small groups of people. The human brain however does not work this way, although specialized areas exist, these areas consist of similar
  	building blocks. Artificial neural networks attempt to mimic this layout. Similar algorithmic structures are used for a wide variety of tasks. This thesis deals with\ the application of neural networks in speech recognition. Replacing the various	subsystems by one integrated network based approach.

  I would like to thank everybody who kept me busy the last year,
  especially my promotor and my assistants. I would also like to thank the
  jury for reading the text. My sincere gratitude also goes to my family
  for supporting me trough my studies.

\begin{abstract}
  Speech recognition is concerned with transcribing what is said in a
  recoding of spoken language. In machine learning terms this process is
  called sequence labeling. A recoding consists of a chain of frames,
  this chain can be split up into several sequences, these make
  up words or phonemes, which must be labeled. The sequence of labels forms
  the transcription. \\
  The meaning of speech depends on context, therefore a good system needs to
  take it into account. Classical feed-forward networks fail to do that, which
  is why this system will mainly consist of recurrently connected Long Short Term
  Memory (LSTM) blocks. Inspired by the recurrent connects of neurons in the human
  brain, LSTM-RNNs have the ability to store information over long time periods,
  an important requirement in take context into account. \\
  In order to train machine learning systems, speech and transcription text
  pairs are used. The text contains the exact information of what is said in
  the recording, but where in the recoding which word or sound is said is unknown.
  In other words text to speech alignment is missing. Aligning the data will be an
  important issue in this thesis.
