abstract = {Speech recognition is concerned with transcribing what is said in a recoding of spoken language. In machine learning terms this process is called sequence labeling. A recoding consists of a chain of frames, this chain can be split up into several sequences, these make up words or phonemes, which must be labeled. The sequence of labels forms the transcription. The meaning of speech depends on context, therefore a good system needs to take it into account. Classical feed-forward networks fail to do that, which is why systems in this thesis mainly consist of recurrently connected Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) blocks. Inspired by the recurrent connections of neurons in the human brain, LSTM-RNNs have the ability to store information over long time periods. In order to train machine learning systems, speech and transcription text pairs are used. The text contains the exact information of what is said in the recording, but where in the recoding which word or sound is said is unknown. In other words text to speech alignment is missing. They key problem in this thesis is data alignment. Potential solutions such as connectionist temporal classification as well as attention based transducers are discussed, with a focus on the latter.},
