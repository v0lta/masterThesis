\section{Listen attend and spell experiments}
\subsection{Testing the Listener}
A crucial part of the listen attend and spell architecture is formed by the listener. Before working with a fully-fledged las a CTC-layer will be attached to the listener.
The idea is to verify the implementation. If CTC can extract relevant information from the listener, the attend and spell code should be able to do the same in later experiments. In order to keep memory requirements manageable in later experiments with the same listener all LSTM cells where set up with 64 hidden units. As the listener layers are bidirectional this means 64 in each direction so the hidden dimension is 128 in total. This sum is important, because the feature dimension of the lstm outputs is concatenated for each time step. If not further action is taken the listener produces features with a dimension of two times the number of elements per lstm.  
CTC runs the logits it is given trough a softmax layer to compute label probabilities. To function it must therefore be given a logit tensor, where the feature dimension is equal to the number of labels, the system is supposed to output. To meet this requirement an extra linear output layer has been added to the listener which maps the feature dimension to 40, as required.

Figure~\ref{fig:listenCTC}, shows the optimization algorithms progress, as measured by trainig loss, validation loss and validation set decoding phoneme error rate. The training was stopped, when the decoding results where no longer improving. During testing a phoneme error rate of \texttt{0.268} was observed, which is a pretty good results compared to the twenty four percent error rate of a comparable full BLSTM architecture given that the pyramidal layer compressed the time dimension into half of its original size. During decoding the CTC beam width was once more set to 100.
